# Prerequisites
FuseSoC is prerequisite. To install FuseSoC in Ubuntu, just type the following command:
```
$ pip3 install --upgrade --user fusesoc
```

Uninstall FuseSoC:
```
$ pip3 uninstall fusesoc
```

# Setup
When this repository is downloaded, fusesoc-cores must be installed in
fusesoc_libraries/fusesoc-cores. To achieve that, just execute:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fusesoc/fusesoc-cores fusesoc_libraries/fusesoc-cores
```

We have to note that fusesoc-cores must reside in fusesoc_libraries/fusesoc-cores,
which is mandatory.

Start a build of 01-blinky for artya7-100t :
```
$ sourcr ${Vivado}/settings64.sh
the environment variable ${Vivado} is the path where Xilinx Vivado is installed.
$ fusesoc run --build --target=artya7-100t 01-blinky
```

# Build
Connect artya7-100t to your PC with a USB cable, then program the bitstream
generated by the last step:
```
$ make pgm -C build/01-blinky_0/artya7-100t-vivado
```
